Q1 - 8 - Good point that ideally Data Scientists shouldn't be asked these questions. 
Data Scientists do sometimes have to articulate the situation so that others realise that an ethical situation has arisen, and that they need help to solve it. 
That's one of the places where ethical blunders get made, when decisions are made by engineers without realising there is a wider ethical context. 
But think about who this "committee or board of professionals" should listen to? where do they get *their* guidance?
